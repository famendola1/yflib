## Yahoo Endpoints
The Yahoo offical documentation for their [Fantasy Sports API](https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide) is not comprehensive and incomplete, despite being the offical. For a more complete overview of the supported endpoints, see the [README](https://github.com/edwarddistel/yahoo-fantasy-baseball-reader#yahoo-fantasy-api-docs).

## Before You Start
The functionality of this package require the use of a `*http.Client` that is configured for the Yahoo Fantasy API endpoint. You can use the [github.com/famendola1/yauth](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/famendola1/yauth) package to configure a `*http.Client` to use.
